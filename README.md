# kyma
Kyma is an audio and image generation tool to help those with anxiety, depression, ptsd, or simply looking to expand their consciousness.

Kyma ðŸŽ¶
Kyma is an interactive web application that allows users to generate personalized binaural beats accompanied by cymatic visualizations. The app is built using Streamlit and offers a user-friendly interface for exploring solfeggio frequencies, brainwave patterns, and emotional intentions through sound and visuals.

Features
Binaural Beats Generation: Create binaural beats using solfeggio frequencies, brainwave patterns, custom frequencies, or emotional intentions.
Cymatic Visualizations: Enjoy real-time cymatic patterns that correspond to the generated audio frequencies.
Emotional Intentions: Select from predefined emotional intentions that influence both the audio and visual outputs.
Waveform Selection: Choose from sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle waveforms for audio generation.
Audio Controls: Adjust volume, panning, and duration of the generated audio.
Download Options: Download the generated audio and cymatic visualizations as files.
Educational Content: Learn about binaural beats, brainwave entrainment, and cymatics through integrated educational resources.
Scientific References: Access a curated list of research studies related to the app's core concepts.
